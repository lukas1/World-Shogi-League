    Uncomment and edit this file to have a default admin user(s) with these
    credentials created, when meteor is first started and these users don't
    yet exist. You can submit an array of users to be created.
    Also rename this file to def-account.coffee, so that you don't commit your
    credentials to GIT (there's a git ignore on that file)

#@DefAdminAccount = [
#    {
#       username: 'username'
#       email: 'example@email.com'
#       password: 'password'
#   }
