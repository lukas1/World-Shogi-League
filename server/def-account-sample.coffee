    Uncomment and edit this file to have a default admin user with these
    credentials created, when meteor is first started and doesn't have any users
    Also rename this file to def-account.coffee, so that you don't commit your
    credentials to GIT (there's a git ignore on that file)
###
#@DefAdminAccount =
#    username: 'username'
#    email: 'example@email.com'
#    password: 'password'
